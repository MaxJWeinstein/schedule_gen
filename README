The entry-point for this utility is the `new_term` script, which takes a season and year suffix (e.g. 'fall 25'). This script creates a new directory for that term, interactively creates a schedule of classes with the help of `main.py`, and makes the symlink `current_term` point to the new term's directory.

Requirements: the scripts use a Python package called `htpy`.
